			<p>Hi there, welcome to "About Me". I don't feel like there's too much to say to say about me but I suppose this is the whole point of this website.</p>
			<p>I am from Chazy, NY. It's quite small, Google estimates it's population is usually a touch over 4000 people. Most of those people are older, although I believe the trend is showing an increase in young people moving into the area. Chazy got it's name on the map (barely) because it was (kind of) the home of William H. Miner. He was really more from Chicago but spent a lot of his childhood in Chazy and came back later. He invented a very big and important coupler that held train cars together back when train cars were a lot more important than they are now. If you want to hear more about my opinions on that though, you'll need to wait until I get the blog section of this site up and make a post about railways.</p>
			<p>The image to the right here was taken at Point Au Roche state park, something people from Chazy sometimes claim but it is really in Plattsburgh by postal code. The image on the homepage was also taken there, where I was a lifeguard for several years.</p>
			<p>I am passionate about many things, the most important to me are described in the headings above, I enjoy math, medicine, computer science, making, working on cars, education, and more. Currently I attend Clarkson University, where hopefully in May of 2023 I'll graduate with my BS in pure mathematics.</p>
			<p>The reality about college for me was that I went a bit too early. I don't regret that decision I still am glad I did it however I was asked as a 16 year old that if I wanted to go to college I needed to pick what I wanted to study that would influence much of the rest of my life. So I started as a Mechanical Engineering major. Then I went on quire the spree, changing tracks left and right as I found that everything interested me, I wanted to be a lawyer, a doctor, I loved Computer Science but realized that it didn't empassion me. That ended in a long and confusing transcript of majors that make me look a little wishy washy:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Mechanical Engineering</li>
				<li>Mathematics</li>
				<li>Mathematics Pre-Law</li>
				<li>Mathematics Pre-Med</li>
				<li>Mathematics & Computer Science</li>
				<li>Mathematics Pre-Med</li>
			</ul>

			<p>The truth is that I really do love all of these things and continue to love them, I left Mechanical Engineering because it bored me a bit, I wanted to make things but I didn't care much about most of what was in a MechE curriculum. Pure Math and Computer Science both fell into the same category for me where I didn't find them particularly hard, I got good grades in the classes without needing to try much, but I found them uninteresting for a long term prospect. I couldn't ever see myself being a software developer or a mathematician even though I enjoyed them as hobbies. Law I had romanticized, I didn't find the reality of the lawyers that I met to be what I wanted in my life. Medicine I could feel that I had a passion for, however when I began studying it the prospect of how much work it involved without me knowing if it was what I truly wanted made it seem daunting. Then when I began in <a href="../pages/ems.html" class = "in-text">EMS</a> I knew quickly that I loved medicine and my ability to gain exposure in the field allowed me to feel more confident in my decision.</p>
			<p>This doesn't mean that I'm ready for medical school, school as a concept is hard for me. I need a break between my undergrad and medical school so I'll likely soon start paramedic school before I jump into the whole medical school business</p>
			<p>Outside of that stuff I enjoy working with my hands, coming from a rural area I live on a little over an acre (an average to small home land area size in my area) and enjoy working outdoors. Our home is heated with a wood boiler in the winters so there are lots of logs to cut and split to burn through the winter. I understand and do cope with the fact that this is environmentally not the best however we have to get warm somehow. I also like working on cars and bikes, I don't live at home in Chazy anymore so it's a bit harder to do this without a garage but when I get the change I still do.</p>
