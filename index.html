		<p>Hello there, my name is Aengus. I come from a small town in what some would call upstate NY, others would call the "North Country". The difference between those is arbitrary and I won't get into it here.</p>
		<p>This is my website, welcome. Here you can find a bit about me, about my interests, and about projects I've done. I'm sort of all over the place, when this site launches I will be a pure mathematics undergrad on the pre-med track. It's a wonky path but you can read more about that in <a href="pages/ems.html">the EMS section</a> or in <a href="pages/math.html">the Math section</a>. They're not unrelated.</p>
		<p>Take some time to browse around, if you have any questions for me you can always contact me using one of the socials at the bottom of the page or my email also at the bottom of the page.</p>
